# decodeR

This is a repository for fun activities/assignments for R learners.  Each folder contains a puzzle focused on the specified skill (or "general" for a variety of general R skills).  These puzzles will ask the Decoder to complete a series of steps, which will unscramble/translate/decrypt a message or construct an image.

Each folder contains a markdown file for the Puzzle, a Solution to the Puzzle, and any source code used to create the Puzzle, as well as the data files the Puzzle depends on.

Each folder also contains a readme with notes for the instructor.  (*Well, eventually they all will have this...*)

PRs welcome, and apologies in advance for any errors in the activities!
