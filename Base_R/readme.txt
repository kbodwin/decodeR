Notes for decoders:

This decoding task requires no non-base libraries to complete.

This activity practices basic R techniques, including:

- anticipating and interpreting error messages
- vectors, matrices, and data frames: creation and manipulation
- basic math operation


Notes for HQ:

{readr} is used in the creation of the secret message, but this can be swapped out.

The message is encoded from letters and punctuation to numbers.

Important!  If you choose to encode a different message, you will need to update the "Checkpoint" hints in the puzzle.
